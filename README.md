## Objective
The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model using linear regression to predict car prices based on various attributes.

## Key Activities
- **Data Collection**: Gathered a comprehensive dataset comprising car attributes such as make, model, year, price, mileage, and more.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure data quality.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Utilized for data manipulation, analysis, and model development.
- **Scikit-learn**: Employed for implementing linear regression modeling and evaluation.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: Used for data handling and numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Utilized for visualizing data distributions and model performance.
